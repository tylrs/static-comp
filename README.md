## Introduction

This project was a challenge to recreate the layout of a given comp and to make the site responsive across multiple screen sizes. We were able to exercise creative freedom with font, colors, copy, and images. The site did not need to be functional in any way. The purpose of the assignment was to get further practice with HTML and CSS.
